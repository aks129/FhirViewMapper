# SQL-on-FHIR View Definition Builder Prototype

## Overview

This application is a comprehensive web-based prototype for building SQL-on-FHIR ViewDefinition resources per the HL7 specification v2.0.0-pre. It allows users to select Implementation Guides (like US Core), choose specific FHIR profiles, and build custom ViewDefinitions through an interactive UI with column mapping, FHIRPath expressions, where clauses, and validation capabilities.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns:

- **Frontend**: React application built with Vite, using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API for profile transformation
- **Development Environment**: Replit-optimized with hot reloading and debugging support

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- Tailwind CSS for styling with Radix UI components
- TanStack Query for server state management
- Wouter for lightweight routing

**Component Structure:**
- Page-based routing with wizard flow (Home → Select IG → Select Profile → Transform → View Results)
- Reusable UI components based on Radix UI primitives
- Custom components for JSON viewing, SQL export, and SQL execution
- Mobile-responsive design with professional theme

**State Management:**
- Local state management using React hooks
- Server state managed through TanStack Query
- Wizard state managed in the main App component
- Form state handled with React Hook Form and Zod validation

### Backend Architecture

**API Structure:**
- RESTful endpoints for implementation guides, profiles, and transformations
- File-based route organization in `server/routes.ts`
- Express middleware for JSON parsing, CORS, and error handling
- Request/response logging for debugging

**Core Services:**
- **Storage Service**: Database abstraction layer supporting CRUD operations
- **Anthropic Service**: AI transformation service for profile-to-SQL conversion
- **Database Connection**: Pooled connections using Neon serverless PostgreSQL

**Database Schema:**
- `users`: User authentication and management
- `implementation_guides`: HL7 Implementation Guide metadata
- `profiles`: FHIR profile definitions and structure definitions
- `transformations`: Generated SQL view definitions and transformations

### Data Storage Solutions

**Primary Database:**
- PostgreSQL via Neon serverless with connection pooling
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Schema-first approach with TypeScript type generation
- Migrations managed through Drizzle Kit

**In-Memory Processing:**
- Better SQLite3 for SQL execution and testing
- Sample FHIR data for view definition validation

### Authentication and Authorization

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic user management schema in place
- Session-based authentication structure prepared
- User creation and retrieval endpoints available

**Future Considerations:**
- Session management can be implemented using connect-pg-simple
- Password hashing and validation to be added
- Role-based access control for different user types

### External Service Integrations

**Anthropic Claude AI:**
- Integration for FHIR profile transformation
- Error handling and retry logic for API calls
- Dynamic API key management through environment variables
- Support for the latest Claude models

**FHIR Implementation Guides:**
- US Core Integration Guide pre-loaded
- Support for importing additional implementation guides
- Profile parsing and structure definition processing

## Data Flow

1. **User Selection Flow:**
   - User selects an Implementation Guide from available options
   - System fetches available resource types for the selected guide
   - User chooses a resource type and specific profile
   - User configures transformation options (schema, extensions, normalization)

2. **Transformation Process:**
   - Profile data and structure definition sent to Claude AI
   - AI generates SQL view definition and platform-specific SQL
   - Results stored in database with unique transformation ID
   - Generated SQL can be tested against sample FHIR data

3. **Result Management:**
   - View definitions displayed in multiple formats (full JSON, flattened view)
   - SQL export functionality for different database platforms
   - SQL execution capability using DuckDB for testing

## External Dependencies

**Core Dependencies:**
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`: Claude AI integration
- `@neondatabase/serverless`: PostgreSQL database connection
- `drizzle-orm`: Type-safe ORM and query builder
- `@tanstack/react-query`: Server state management
- `@radix-ui/*`: UI component primitives
- `better-sqlite3`: In-memory SQL execution

**Development Dependencies:**
- `tsx`: TypeScript execution for development
- `esbuild`: Fast JavaScript bundler for production
- `vite`: Frontend build tool and development server
- `tailwindcss`: Utility-first CSS framework

## Deployment Strategy

**Replit Configuration:**
- Node.js 20 runtime with PostgreSQL 16 module
- Automatic dependency installation and hot reloading
- Environment variable management for API keys and database URLs
- Production build process using Vite and esbuild

**Build Process:**
- Frontend: Vite builds React application to `dist/public`
- Backend: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Static asset serving integrated into Express server

**Environment Variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude AI API key (required for transformations)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment setting (development/production)
