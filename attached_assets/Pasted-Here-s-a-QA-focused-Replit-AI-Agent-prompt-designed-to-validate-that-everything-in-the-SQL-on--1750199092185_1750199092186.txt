Here‚Äôs a **QA-focused Replit AI Agent prompt** designed to validate that everything in the **SQL-on-FHIR View Definition Builder** prototype is functioning correctly. This can be used **after the initial prototype is created** to confirm completeness, correctness, and usability across features:

**‚úÖ Prompt: Functionality and QA Validation for SQL-on-FHIR View Definition Builder**

You are a QA engineer validating a Replit prototype for a **SQL-on-FHIR View Definition Builder**. The goal is to ensure that every component works correctly, generates valid output per HL7 standards, and provides a smooth end-user experience.

Please test and verify the following:

---

### üîç FUNCTIONAL TESTS

#### 1. **Implementation Guide Loading**

* [ ] Can the app load an Implementation Guide (e.g. US Core) from a local JSON file or external URL?
* [ ] Does it parse available **profiles** (e.g. Patient, Observation, Condition) and list them in a dropdown?

#### 2. **Profile Selection**

* [ ] Upon selecting a profile, are relevant **elements and paths** loaded (e.g. `Patient.birthDate`, `Patient.identifier.value`)?
* [ ] Are column suggestions based on StructureDefinition `element.path` values and FHIRPath mappings?

#### 3. **Column Builder**

* [ ] Can user add/remove columns?
* [ ] Can user input or select:

  * Column name
  * FHIRPath expression
  * `forEach`, `unionAll`, `forEachOrNull`, and `constant` flags
* [ ] Is the ViewDefinition's `select` array populated correctly?

#### 4. **Where Clause Editor**

* [ ] Can user add filters using valid FHIRPath (e.g. `status='active'`)?
* [ ] Are invalid FHIRPath expressions flagged?

#### 5. **ViewDefinition Output**

* [ ] Is the generated ViewDefinition valid JSON?
* [ ] Does it conform to the HL7 `ViewDefinition` specification (v2.0.0-pre)?
* [ ] Does it include `resource`, `name`, `title`, `status`, `select`, and optional `where` or `constant`?

#### 6. **Validation Engine**

* [ ] Does the system validate ViewDefinition JSON against its schema (JSON Schema or HL7 IG Publisher)?
* [ ] Do errors get reported clearly to the user?

#### 7. **Preview / Execute**

* [ ] Can users upload a sample FHIR resource (JSON or NDJSON)?
* [ ] Does the tool run the generated ViewDefinition logic (FHIRPath evaluation)?
* [ ] Are results displayed in a table?

#### 8. **Export Options**

* [ ] Can users export the ViewDefinition as a `.json` file?
* [ ] Can users export the execution result as a `.csv` file?

### üß™ EDGE CASES TO TEST

* Load a malformed Implementation Guide
* Use invalid FHIRPath syntax
* Add 0 columns and try to generate ViewDefinition
* Use deeply nested FHIRPath expressions
* Try with an unknown or custom profile

---

### üß† Bonus: UX Suggestions

* Is the builder intuitive and beginner-friendly?
* Do form fields auto-fill intelligently based on IG info?
* Are errors user-friendly and non-technical?
